# Task-2 : Chat Application

Server: It is designed as a multithreaded application that can handle multiple clients simultaneously. It has an object-oriented implementation that spawns multiple client threads upon each connection.

Client: It is designed in a class-based fashion. The client helps to connect to the server. It helps  to receive and send messages and commands.

ChatRooms: They are designed in an object-oriented manner. Chat history is stored in a file format for each chatroom.
